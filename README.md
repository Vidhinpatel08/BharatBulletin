# BharatBulletin News

 ## **Description**

This React.js project fetches project details from the GitHub repository "[https://github.com/Vidhinpatel08/BharatBulletin](https://github.com/Vidhinpatel08/BharatBulletin)" and utilizes the NewsCatcher API to retrieve news articles. It leverages the GitHub API to obtain information about the repository, such as its name, description, owner, language, stars, and forks. The NewsCatcher API allows you to search for news articles based on various criteria, such as keywords, language, and sources.

 ## **Additional Notes**

**Limitations:**

- This project is currently in its early stages of development.
- The scope of the project may be limited to fetching and displaying basic information about the BharatBulletin repository and news articles from the NewsCatcher API.

**Known Issues:**

- There may be bugs or errors in the current code.
- The project may not be fully functional at this stage.

**Future Plans:**

- We plan to add more features to the project, such as the ability to search for specific news articles.
- We may improve the user interface and user experience.

**We appreciate your interest in contributing to this project!** If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contact us directly.

 ## **Potential Issues and Considerations**

- **API Rate Limits:** Be mindful of API rate limits for both the GitHub API and the NewsCatcher API. Implement caching or pagination mechanisms to avoid exceeding these limits.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle situations where API requests fail or the fetched data is not in the expected format.
- **Security:** Remember that the `.env.local` file is not included in version control (e.g., Git) to prevent exposing your API key.
